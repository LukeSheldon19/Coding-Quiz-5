Mars: The time complexity of the Mars code is O(n), as the runtime is only dependent of iterating through the parameter String s, which we know will have a size of n. The space complexity is constant(O(1))
on the other hand, because our stored data in integers and characters are not dependent on input size and thus remain constant.
